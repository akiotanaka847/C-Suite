"""Fixture load / unload / reset must clear the external-monitoring tables.

Before this change the ``watchlist`` and ``external_signals`` tables were
never wiped by the fixture loader. A research scan (or onboarding) would
populate the watchlist with AI/competitor monitors, and those rows then
leaked into every subsequent fixture load and into the restored user state
on unload — the "clean" fixture inherited the previous company's monitors.

The fix routes both the shared load/unload path (``_apply_state_from_source``)
and ``reset_all_state`` through ``_delete_all_rows`` with the two monitoring
tables, ``external_signals`` first so the FK
(``external_signals.watchlist_id`` → ``watchlist.id``) is never violated
under ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON``.

We exercise ``_delete_all_rows`` directly (the same helper both call sites
delegate to) so the assertion that matters — the deletion works against the
live schema in the correct FK order — is proven without dragging ChromaDB,
Honcho, and an ``app.state`` shim into a unit test.
